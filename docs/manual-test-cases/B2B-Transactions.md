# Manual Test Cases — B2B Transactions

Context: this document covers the Business-portal (Biller/Merchant) transaction flows sourced from
the EMI Jira project (`project = EMI`): **Create Bill** (EMI-183, EMI-242, EMI-3020 — Bill Management
epic EMI-2179/EMI-2178), **Pay Bill** (EMI-170 — Bill Payment epic), **Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer**
(EMI-4281 Business W2W, epic EMI-2196), **Top Up** (EMI-171 Cash-in, EMI-3564 SADAD top-up), **Wallet
Payment QR** (EMI-590 QR payment, EMI-3545 Dynamic QR, EMI-922 QR management — epic EMI-2204/EMI-2197),
and **Guest Flow** (EMI-5424, EMI-5446, EMI-5523, EMI-5551, EMI-5640, EMI-5653, EMI-5860 — public
payment-link / QR checkout without login). Ticket keys are noted per section/case so failures can be
traced back to source requirements.

Sections G–R apply the platform-wide **Limitation Management** (EMI-1653, EMI-195, EMI-87, EMI-659 —
epic EMI-2185) and **Commission Management** (EMI-2031 — epic EMI-2186) admin-configured rules to each
of the four money-movement flows (W2W Transfer, Pay Bill, Top Up, QR Payment), the same way
`BankTransfer.md`'s sections E/F do for Cashout. These rules are configured in the Admin Portal by
**Risk Level** × **Wallet Type/Tier** (Merchant, Biller) × **Transaction Type** × **Platform** (Web,
App) × **Period** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), per EMI-87's and EMI-2031's acceptance criteria — every
case below requires that Admin Portal setup step first, same caveat `BankTransfer.md` documents for
EMI-180.

Priority key: **P1** = blocks the release / core happy path, **P2** = important secondary behavior,
**P3** = edge case / polish.

## A. Create Bill (Biller — EMI-183, EMI-242, EMI-3020)

Context: a Biller creates bills either manually (single or itemized/detailed entry) via the portal, or
in bulk via a protected Excel template. Bills can optionally reference a private "My Products" catalog
(EMI-3020) for faster itemized entry. Newly created/edited bills require approval before a Merchant can
pay them (see section B).

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CB-01 | Single bill entry — required fields only | Biller opens "Add Bill" → Single Bill Entry, fills Beneficiary, Bill Ref., Amount, leaves Discount/VAT/Dates/Description empty, submits | Bill is created; discount shows "-"/0, VAT default checkbox state respected, no expiry = infinite | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-02 | Single bill entry — full fields with VAT and discount | Fill all optional fields: Fixed discount (non-zero), "Apply 15% VAT" checked, Issue/Expiry dates, Description | Bill Confirmation summary shows correct amount breakdown: Initial → Discount → Amount after discount → VAT → Total | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-03 | Discount type "None" is default and hides amount field | Open Add Bill form | Discount type defaults to "No discount"; discount amount field is hidden; discount excluded from API payload | P1 | EMI-183 |

| CB-05 | Zero discount value rejected when a discount type is selected | Select Fixed discount, enter 0 as the amount | Validation error — a non-zero value is required when a discount type is selected | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-06 | Detailed bill entry — add multiple items | Open Detailed Bill Entry, add ≥2 items with Name/Qty/Unit Price/Discount/VAT | Bill Items list reflects all items; Section 3 confirmation shows per-item and aggregate totals | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-07 | Detailed bill entry — item-level VAT/discount independent of master | Set different VAT/discount per item | Each item's amount breakdown (Initial/Discount/After discount/VAT/Total) is computed independently and summed correctly at bill level | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-08 | Optional expiry — bill never expires | Leave Expiry Date empty on creation | Bill is created with no expiry and remains payable indefinitely (never auto-flagged Expired) | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-09 | Add product from "My Products" to a detailed bill | On Section 2 (Bill Items), open the product multi-select and choose a saved product | Selected product is added as a line item with its saved Name/Price/VAT/Discount pre-filled | P1 | EMI-3020 |

| CB-12 | Product VAT validation range | Enter VAT as -5 or 120 on a product | Inline error: "VAT must be a number between 0–100" | P2 | EMI-3020 |
| CB-13 | Soft-deleted product removed from dropdown, not from history | Delete a product already used on a past bill | Product disappears from the invoice item dropdown; historical bill still shows original item data | P2 | EMI-3020 |
| CB-14 | Bulk upload — valid Excel file | Upload a correctly filled, unmodified protected Excel template with N bill rows | All N bills are created; checksum validated; no tampering detected | P1 | EMI-242 |
| CB-15 | Bulk upload — tampered file rejected | Modify the protected Excel template outside allowed cells, then upload | Upload rejected — checksum mismatch detected, no bills created | P1 | EMI-242 |
| CB-16 | Bulk upload — one invalid row rolls back the whole batch | Upload a file where row 5 of 10 fails bill-creation validation | All 10 rows are rejected (atomic rollback); validation errors returned per failing row; zero bills created | P1 | EMI-242 |
| CB-17 | Bulk upload — file processing error surfaced clearly | Upload a corrupted/unreadable file | A user-friendly error is shown; no partial data is created | P2 | EMI-242 |
| CB-18 | View Bills list — Biller row/detail fields | Open "View Bills" as Biller | Row shows Bill Ref., Beneficiary brand name, Total Amount, Expiry Date, Status; detail view adds Bill type, Discount, VAT, amount breakdown, Bill Dates, QR image | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-19 | Unapproved / not-yet-issued bills hidden from Merchant | Create a bill with a future issue date or leave it unapproved | Bill is not visible in the Merchant's received-bills list until issue date is reached and it is approved | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-20 | Filter bills by reference/date/status | On View Bills, filter by Bill Reference, Date Range, and Status | List narrows to matching bills only; irrelevant bills excluded | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-21 | Approve/Reject a bill | Reviewer opens a Pending bill and selects Approve (or Reject) | Status updates in real time and persists to the DB; Merchant visibility follows the new status | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-22 | Editing an approved bill re-triggers approval | Edit the amount on an already-Approved bill | Bill flips back to Pending/unapproved and requires re-approval before it can be paid | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-23 | Edit restricted to unpaid bills only | Attempt to edit a bill already marked Paid | Edit is blocked/disabled for Paid bills | P1 | EMI-183 |
| CB-24 | Deleting all items shows confirmation dialog | On a detailed bill, delete the last remaining item | Confirmation dialog: "By continuing with deletion process, bill amount will become 0, are you sure you want to proceed?" | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-25 | Delete a bill | Biller deletes a bill they own | Bill is removed from the active list | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-26 | Audit trail records lifecycle events | Create, edit, view, and delete a bill in sequence | Audit log contains one entry per action with actor, timestamp, and description | P2 | EMI-183 |
| CB-27 | Bill Ref. uniqueness / required field enforcement | Attempt to submit a bill with an empty Bill Ref. or Amount | Form blocks submission with a required-field validation message | P1 | EMI-183 |

## E. Wallet Payment QR (EMI-590, EMI-3545, EMI-922)

Context: a customer/merchant pays via QR in one of two modes — a **Dynamic/Amount QR** (fixed,
one-time-use amount baked into the code) or a **Wallet QR** (identifies a wallet only; payer enters
the amount manually). QR payloads must comply with EMVCo specs and be signed/encrypted server-side.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QR-01 | Payment entry opens full-screen scanner | Open "Scan QR" / "Pay via QR" | Camera opens full screen with the option to choose Dynamic QR or Wallet QR mode | P1 | EMI-590 |

## F. Guest Flow (Payment Links / Guest Checkout — EMI-5424, EMI-5446, EMI-5523, EMI-5551, EMI-5640, EMI-5653, EMI-5860)

Context: an unauthenticated ("guest") user can pay a bill or a wallet by opening a public payment
link or scanning a QR generated by a logged-in user, without creating an account. The backend
resolves the link/QR token, validates it, and issues a short-lived guest JWT session scoped to
that single payment.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GF-01 | Logged-in user generates a guest wallet payment link | While logged in, open wallet QR / "generate guest link", copy the link | A shareable public link (and/or QR) is generated referencing the wallet and is copyable | P1 | EMI-5424 |
| GF-02 | Guest opens a valid wallet link in a fresh browser (no session) | Paste the guest link into a separate/incognito browser with no login | Link resolves; sanitized payment summary is shown (wallet name masked, open amount or fixed amount + fees) — no internal/sensitive data exposed | P1 | EMI-5424 / EMI-5860 |
| GF-03 | Guest opens a valid bill link in a fresh browser | Open a guest link pointing to an invoice/bill | Link resolves; sanitized bill summary shown (amount, fees, VAT) | P1 | EMI-5424 |
| GF-04 | Guest session (JWT) generated on resolution | Open any valid guest link | Backend issues a JWT bound to the link ID and reference type (INVOICE/BILL or WALLET); stateless, single-link scope, high-entropy non-enumerable token | P1 | EMI-5446 |
| GF-05 | Expired guest link rejected | Open a guest link/QR past its expiry | Clear "invalid or expired" message; no payment summary or JWT issued | P1 | EMI-5424 / EMI-5446 |
| GF-06 | Disabled/already-paid link rejected | Open a guest link whose underlying bill is already Paid, or whose link is disabled | Clear rejection message; guest cannot proceed to pay | P1 | EMI-5424 |
| GF-07 | Scanning a wallet QR as a guest succeeds (regression, EMI-5551) | As an unauthenticated user, scan a valid wallet QR | Payment link/summary resolves — must NOT show "Payment link not found" | P1 | EMI-5551 |
| GF-08 | Guest wallet payment does not fail with a generic error (regression, EMI-5640) | As a guest, scan a wallet QR and attempt payment | Payment proceeds normally — must NOT show a generic "Wallet Payment Failed" | P1 | EMI-5640 |
| GF-09 | Location-permission prompt does not block guest payment (regression, EMI-5653) | As a guest, scan a wallet QR that triggers a location-permission popup | Popup is clickable/dismissible; guest can proceed to complete payment | P2 | EMI-5653 |
| GF-10 | Guest wallet payment does not fail with "invalid wallet code" (regression, EMI-5860) | Logged-in user generates a guest wallet link, copies it, opens it in a separate browser, completes the payment steps | Payment completes successfully — must NOT show "Payment failed (invalid wallet code)" | P1 | EMI-5860 |
| GF-11 | Guest bill payment processes correctly | Open a valid guest bill link, submit payment with valid details | Payment is processed; bill status updates to Paid; guest sees a success confirmation | P1 | EMI-5523 |
| GF-12 | Guest payment blocked once the underlying reference becomes ineligible mid-session | Open a valid guest link, then have the bill get paid/cancelled by another channel before the guest confirms | Guest's payment attempt is rejected with a clear message rather than double-processing | P2 | EMI-5424 |
| GF-13 | No sensitive/internal data exposed to guest | Inspect the payment summary and any error responses returned to a guest session | Only sanitized fields are present — no internal IDs, stack traces, or other users' data | P1 | EMI-5446 |
| GF-14 | Guest JWT cannot be reused across different links | Obtain a guest JWT from link A, attempt to use it against link B's payment endpoint | Request is rejected — token is scoped to its originating link only | P2 | EMI-5446 |
| GF-15 | Rate limiting on public guest endpoints | Rapidly repeat guest link/QR resolution requests | Excessive requests are throttled/blocked rather than allowed unlimited retries | P3 | EMI-5446 |

## G. Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer — Wallet Balance Limits (EMI-659, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: Admin Portal → Manage Limits → Wallet Balance caps a wallet's balance by Risk Level × Wallet
Type (Merchant, Biller). A transfer is blocked if it would push the **sender** below their configured
minimum, or push the **receiver** above their configured maximum.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WT-WB01 | Sender transfer within min-balance floor succeeds (Merchant, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Merchant min-balance floor and saves. Sender transfers an amount that leaves their balance above the floor | Transfer succeeds; sender's post-transfer balance stays above the configured minimum | P1 |
| WT-WB02 | Sender transfer breaching min-balance floor is blocked (Merchant, Low risk) | Same setup; sender transfers an amount that would drop their balance below the floor | Transfer is rejected before OTP with a clear message; sender balance unchanged | P1 |
| WT-WB03 | Receiver credit within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Biller max-balance ceiling and saves. Sender transfers an amount that leaves the receiver's balance under the ceiling | Transfer succeeds; receiver's post-transfer balance stays under the configured maximum | P1 |
| WT-WB04 | Receiver credit breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Low risk) | Same setup; sender transfers an amount that would push the receiver's balance over the ceiling | Transfer is rejected with a clear message; neither wallet is debited/credited | P1 |
| WT-WB05 | Sender transfer within min-balance floor succeeds (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat WT-WB01 with the Medium-risk Merchant floor | Transfer succeeds as expected | P2 |
| WT-WB06 | Sender transfer breaching min-balance floor is blocked (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat WT-WB02 with the Medium-risk Merchant floor | Transfer is rejected | P2 |
| WT-WB07 | Receiver credit within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat WT-WB03 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Transfer succeeds as expected | P2 |
| WT-WB08 | Receiver credit breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat WT-WB04 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Transfer is rejected | P2 |

## H. Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer — Transaction Limits (EMI-87, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: Admin Portal → Manage Limits → Transaction caps W2W transfers by Risk Level × Wallet Tier ×
Platform (Web/App) × Period (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), on both cumulative **amount** and **count** of
transfers.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WT-TL01 | Transfers within the daily amount limit succeed (Web) | Admin sets a daily cumulative-amount ceiling for W2W transfer on Web and saves. Sender makes transfers totalling under the ceiling | Each transfer completes normally | P1 |
| WT-TL02 | Cumulative transfers exceeding the daily amount limit are blocked (Web) | Same setup; sender's next transfer would push the day's total over the ceiling | That transfer is rejected with a clear limit-exceeded message | P1 |
| WT-TL03 | Transfers within the weekly amount limit succeed (Web) | Admin sets a weekly amount ceiling; sender transfers within it across the week | Each transfer completes normally | P2 |
| WT-TL04 | Cumulative transfers exceeding the weekly amount limit are blocked (Web) | Same setup; sender's transfer would exceed the weekly ceiling | Transfer is rejected | P2 |
| WT-TL05 | Transfers within the monthly amount limit succeed (App) | Admin sets a monthly amount ceiling for the App platform; sender transfers within it | Each transfer completes normally | P2 |
| WT-TL06 | Cumulative transfers exceeding the monthly amount limit are blocked (App) | Same setup; sender's transfer would exceed the monthly ceiling | Transfer is rejected | P1 |
| WT-TL07 | Transfers within the daily count limit succeed | Admin sets a daily transfer-count ceiling and saves. Sender makes transfers up to that count | Each transfer within the count succeeds | P2 |
| WT-TL08 | Transfer once the daily count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; sender attempts one more transfer past the count ceiling | Transfer is rejected with a clear message | P1 |
| WT-TL09 | Transfers within the weekly count limit succeed | Admin sets a weekly count ceiling; sender transfers up to that count | Each transfer succeeds | P2 |
| WT-TL10 | Transfer once the weekly count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; sender exceeds the weekly count | Transfer is rejected | P2 |
| WT-TL11 | Transfers within the monthly count limit succeed | Admin sets a monthly count ceiling; sender transfers up to that count | Each transfer succeeds | P2 |
| WT-TL12 | Transfer once the monthly count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; sender exceeds the monthly count | Transfer is rejected | P2 |

## I. Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer — Commission (EMI-2031)

Context: Admin Portal → Commission Management configures a **Default** (platform-wide) or **Custom**
(per business account) commission schema for W2W transfer, by Platform, Min/Max amount, and Fixed or
Percentage type. Commission is added to the sender's debit and deducted from the receiver's credit.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WT-CM01 | Default schema applies when no custom commission exists | Ensure no custom commission is configured for the sender's business account; complete a transfer | The platform-wide default commission schema is applied | P2 |
| WT-CM02 | Custom per-account schema overrides the default | Admin configures a custom commission for the sender's specific business account; complete a transfer | The custom commission is applied instead of the default | P2 |
| WT-CM03 | Fixed commission deducted on a standard transfer | Admin configures a fixed-amount commission for W2W transfer; sender transfers within its applicable range | Commission summary reflects the fixed amount; sender's debit includes it, receiver's credit is net of it | P1 |
| WT-CM04 | Fixed commission applied at minimum boundary | Same setup; transfer an amount equal to the configured minimum | Fixed commission is deducted | P2 |
| WT-CM05 | Fixed commission applied at maximum boundary | Same setup; transfer an amount equal to the configured maximum | Fixed commission is deducted | P2 |
| WT-CM06 | Fixed commission not applied below minimum | Same setup; transfer an amount below the configured minimum | No commission is applied for that transfer | P2 |
| WT-CM07 | Fixed commission not applied above maximum | Same setup; transfer an amount above the configured maximum | No commission is applied for that transfer | P2 |
| WT-CM08 | Percentage commission deducted on a standard transfer | Admin configures a percentage commission; sender transfers within its range | Commission reflects the correct percentage of the transfer amount | P2 |
| WT-CM09 | Percentage commission applied at minimum boundary | Same setup; transfer equal to the configured minimum | Percentage commission is deducted | P2 |
| WT-CM10 | Percentage commission applied at maximum boundary | Same setup; transfer equal to the configured maximum | Percentage commission is deducted | P2 |
| WT-CM11 | Percentage commission not applied below minimum | Same setup; transfer below the configured minimum | No commission applied | P2 |
| WT-CM12 | Percentage commission not applied above maximum | Same setup; transfer above the configured maximum | No commission applied | P2 |
| WT-CM13 | Commission added on sender side / deducted on receiver side | Complete a transfer with an active commission | Sender's total debit = amount + commission; receiver's credit = amount − commission (per EMI-2031's dual-side rule) | P1 |
| WT-CM14 | Overlapping commission rules rejected | Admin attempts to create a second commission rule for the same transaction type/platform/amount range as an existing one | System rejects with a clear "overlapping rule" error | P2 |
| WT-CM15 | Min amount cannot exceed max amount | Admin attempts to save a commission rule with Min > Max | Validation blocks save with a clear error | P2 |
| WT-CM16 | Transaction type cannot be edited on an existing commission | Admin opens an existing commission rule and attempts to change its transaction type | Field is read-only/disabled for editing | P3 |
| WT-CM17 | Disabling a commission schema stops it applying | Admin disables an active custom commission schema; sender transfers | Transfer completes with no commission applied (falls back to default, if any) | P2 |
| WT-CM18 | Re-enabling a commission schema resumes applying it | Admin re-enables the schema from WT-CM17; sender transfers again | Commission is applied again as configured | P3 |

## J. Pay Bill — Wallet Balance Limits (EMI-659, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal wallet-balance mechanism as section G, applied to Bill Payment — the
**payer** (Merchant/Customer) must not drop below their minimum, and the **biller** being paid must
not exceed their maximum.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PB-WB01 | Payer bill payment within min-balance floor succeeds (Merchant, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Merchant min-balance floor. Payer pays a bill leaving their balance above the floor | Payment succeeds | P1 |
| PB-WB02 | Payer bill payment breaching min-balance floor is blocked (Merchant, Low risk) | Same setup; paying the bill would drop the payer below the floor | Payment is rejected before completion with a clear message | P1 |
| PB-WB03 | Biller credit within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Biller max-balance ceiling. Payer pays a bill leaving the biller's balance under the ceiling | Payment succeeds | P1 |
| PB-WB04 | Biller credit breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Low risk) | Same setup; the payment would push the biller over the ceiling | Payment is rejected; bill remains unpaid/pending | P1 |
| PB-WB05 | Payer bill payment within min-balance floor succeeds (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat PB-WB01 with the Medium-risk Merchant floor | Payment succeeds | P2 |
| PB-WB06 | Payer bill payment breaching min-balance floor is blocked (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat PB-WB02 with the Medium-risk Merchant floor | Payment is rejected | P2 |
| PB-WB07 | Biller credit within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat PB-WB03 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Payment succeeds | P2 |
| PB-WB08 | Biller credit breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat PB-WB04 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Payment is rejected | P2 |

## K. Pay Bill — Transaction Limits (EMI-87, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal transaction-limit mechanism as section H, applied to Bill Payment by Risk
Level × Wallet Tier × Platform × Period. EMI-87's own example table explicitly names "Biller bill
payment" as a configured transaction type.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PB-TL01 | Bill payments within the daily amount limit succeed (Web) | Admin sets a daily cumulative-amount ceiling for bill payment on Web. Payer pays bills totalling under the ceiling | Each payment completes normally | P1 |
| PB-TL02 | Cumulative bill payments exceeding the daily amount limit are blocked (Web) | Same setup; the next payment would exceed the day's ceiling | That payment is rejected with a clear message | P1 |
| PB-TL03 | Bill payments within the weekly amount limit succeed (Web) | Admin sets a weekly amount ceiling; payer pays within it | Each payment completes normally | P2 |

| PB-TL08 | Bill payment once the daily count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; payer attempts one more payment past the count ceiling | Payment is rejected | P1 |
| PB-TL09 | Bill payments within the weekly count limit succeed | Admin sets a weekly count ceiling; payer pays up to that count | Each payment succeeds | P2 |
| PB-TL10 | Bill payment once the weekly count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; payer exceeds the weekly count | Payment is rejected | P2 |
| PB-TL11 | Bill payments within the monthly count limit succeed | Admin sets a monthly count ceiling; payer pays up to that count | Each payment succeeds | P2 |
| PB-TL12 | Bill payment once the monthly count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; payer exceeds the monthly count | Payment is rejected | P2 |

## L. Pay Bill — Commission (EMI-2031)

Context: same Admin Portal commission mechanism as section I, applied to Bill Payment. Commission is
added to the payer's debit and deducted from the biller's credit.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PB-CM01 | Default schema applies when no custom commission exists | Ensure no custom commission is configured for the payer's business account; pay a bill | Default commission schema applies | P2 |
| PB-CM02 | Custom per-account schema overrides the default | Admin configures a custom commission for the payer's account; pay a bill | Custom commission is applied instead of the default | P2 |
| PB-CM03 | Fixed commission deducted on a standard bill payment | Admin configures a fixed-amount commission for Bill Payment; payer pays a bill within its range | Commission summary reflects the fixed amount | P1 |
| PB-CM04 | Fixed commission applied at minimum boundary | Same setup; bill amount equals the configured minimum | Fixed commission is deducted | P2 |

| PB-CM18 | Re-enabling a commission schema resumes applying it | Admin re-enables the schema; payer pays another bill | Commission applied again | P3 |

## M. Top Up — Wallet Balance Limits (EMI-659, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal wallet-balance mechanism as section G, applied to Top Up. Since top-up only
credits the user's own wallet (funds enter from outside the platform via HyperPay/VIBAN/SADAD), only
the **maximum** balance ceiling is relevant here — there's no sender wallet inside the platform to hit
a minimum floor.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TU-WB01 | Top-up within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Merchant, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Merchant max-balance ceiling. User tops up an amount that leaves their balance under the ceiling | Top-up succeeds; balance credited | P1 |
| TU-WB02 | Top-up breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Merchant, Low risk) | Same setup; the top-up would push the balance over the ceiling | Top-up is rejected before payment capture with a clear message | P1 |
| TU-WB03 | Top-up within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Biller max-balance ceiling. User tops up within it | Top-up succeeds | P2 |
| TU-WB04 | Top-up breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Low risk) | Same setup; top-up would exceed the ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P2 |
| TU-WB05 | Top-up within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat TU-WB01 with the Medium-risk Merchant ceiling | Top-up succeeds | P2 |
| TU-WB06 | Top-up breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Merchant, Medium risk) | Repeat TU-WB02 with the Medium-risk Merchant ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P2 |
| TU-WB07 | Top-up within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat TU-WB03 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Top-up succeeds | P2 |
| TU-WB08 | Top-up breaching max-balance ceiling is blocked (Biller, Medium risk) | Repeat TU-WB04 with the Medium-risk Biller ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P2 |

## N. Top Up — Transaction Limits (EMI-87, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal mechanism as section H, applied to Top Up — EMI-87's own example table
explicitly names "Merchant top-up" as a configured transaction type, including a High-risk example
where the count limit is 0 (top-up disabled entirely for that risk tier).

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TU-TL01 | Top-ups within the daily amount limit succeed (App) | Admin sets a daily cumulative-amount ceiling for top-up on App. User tops up totalling under the ceiling | Each top-up completes normally | P1 |
| TU-TL02 | Cumulative top-ups exceeding the daily amount limit are blocked (App) | Same setup; next top-up would exceed the day's ceiling | That top-up is rejected with a clear message | P1 |
| TU-TL03 | Top-ups within the weekly amount limit succeed | Admin sets a weekly amount ceiling; user tops up within it | Each top-up completes normally | P2 |
| TU-TL04 | Cumulative top-ups exceeding the weekly amount limit are blocked | Same setup; top-up would exceed the weekly ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P2 |
| TU-TL05 | Top-ups within the monthly amount limit succeed | Admin sets a monthly amount ceiling; user tops up within it | Each top-up completes normally | P2 |
| TU-TL06 | Cumulative top-ups exceeding the monthly amount limit are blocked | Same setup; top-up would exceed the monthly ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P1 |
| TU-TL07 | Top-ups within the daily count limit succeed | Admin sets a daily top-up count ceiling. User tops up up to that count | Each top-up within the count succeeds | P2 |
| TU-TL08 | Top-up once the daily count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; user attempts one more top-up past the count ceiling | Top-up is rejected | P1 |
| TU-TL09 | High-risk account with a 0 count limit cannot top up at all | Admin sets the top-up count limit to 0 for a High-risk tier (per EMI-87's own example) | Any top-up attempt is immediately blocked | P1 |
| TU-TL10 | Top-ups within the monthly count limit succeed | Admin sets a monthly count ceiling; user tops up up to that count | Each top-up succeeds | P2 |
| TU-TL11 | Top-up once the monthly count limit is exceeded is blocked | Same setup; user exceeds the monthly count | Top-up is rejected | P2 |
| TU-TL12 | Top-ups within the weekly count limit succeed | Admin sets a weekly count ceiling; user tops up up to that count | Each top-up succeeds | P2 |

## O. Top Up — Commission (EMI-2031)

Context: same Admin Portal commission mechanism as section I, applied to Top Up. Since top-up has no
in-platform counterparty, commission (if configured) is deducted from the credited amount rather than
split across sender/receiver.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TU-CM01 | Default schema applies when no custom commission exists | Ensure no custom commission for the user's account; top up | Default commission schema applies | P2 |

| TU-CM03 | Fixed commission deducted on a standard top-up | Admin configures a fixed-amount commission for Top Up; user tops up within its range | Wallet is credited the top-up amount minus the fixed commission | P1 |
| TU-CM04 | Fixed commission applied at minimum boundary | Same setup; top-up amount equals the configured minimum | Fixed commission is deducted | P2 |
| TU-CM05 | Fixed commission applied at maximum boundary | Same setup; top-up amount equals the configured maximum | Fixed commission is deducted | P2 |
| TU-CM06 | Fixed commission not applied below minimum | Same setup; top-up amount below the configured minimum | No commission applied | P2 |
| TU-CM07 | Fixed commission not applied above maximum | Same setup; top-up amount above the configured maximum | No commission applied | P2 |

## P. Wallet Payment QR — Wallet Balance Limits (EMI-659, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal wallet-balance mechanism as section G, applied to QR payment — the
**payer** must not drop below their minimum, and the **payee** (merchant/wallet being paid) must not
exceed their maximum.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QR-WB01 | Payer QR payment within min-balance floor succeeds (Merchant, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Merchant min-balance floor. Payer completes a QR payment leaving their balance above the floor | Payment succeeds | P1 |
| QR-WB02 | Payer QR payment breaching min-balance floor is blocked (Merchant, Low risk) | Same setup; the payment would drop the payer below the floor | Payment is rejected before OTP with a clear message | P1 |
| QR-WB03 | Payee credit within max-balance ceiling succeeds (Biller, Low risk) | Admin sets a Low-risk Biller max-balance ceiling. Payer's QR payment leaves the payee's balance under the ceiling | Payment succeeds | P1 |

## Q. Wallet Payment QR — Transaction Limits (EMI-87, EMI-1653, EMI-195)

Context: same Admin Portal mechanism as section H, applied to QR payment (Merchant Payment transaction
type) by Risk Level × Wallet Tier × Platform × Period.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## R. Wallet Payment QR — Commission (EMI-2031)

Context: same Admin Portal commission mechanism as section I, applied to QR payment. Commission is
added to the payer's debit and deducted from the payee's credit, consistent with EMI-590's own AC
("applicable commission fees applied automatically").

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |

## Automated coverage note

- **Pay Bill** — `BusinessTestCases/PayBill/functional/PayBillFlow.spec.ts` covers PB-05, PB-06, PB-07,
  PB-08 end to end against a live "Approved" received bill. PB-01–PB-04, PB-09–PB-12 (bill eligibility
  gating, retry-after-failure, success-screen navigation) need dedicated multi-status bill fixtures and
  are not yet automated — track manually until that test data exists.
- **Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer** — `BusinessTestCases/W2WTransfer/functional/W2WTransferFunctionality.spec.ts`
  covers WT-01 (CRN lookup), WT-03, WT-05 (purpose selection), WT-07 (implicitly via balance checks),
  WT-09–WT-11, WT-14–WT-18. WT-02 (QR-scan recipient selection), WT-04 (min/max limit), WT-06 (notes
  200-char limit), WT-08 (account/wallet-limitation block), WT-10 (incorrect-OTP path), WT-12–WT-13
  (commission/notification) are not yet automated.
- **Top Up** — `BusinessTestCases/Topup/functional/TopupFlow.spec.ts` covers TU-01–TU-05 (HyperPay card
  flow) in full, including failed/pending gateway simulation. TU-06–TU-14 (VIBAN bank-transfer top-up,
  SADAD bill top-up) have no automation yet — VIBAN requires real bank-integration polling and SADAD
  is a "To Do" story not yet built in UAT; see `docs/Automation_Test_Cases.md` once added.
- **Wallet Payment QR** — no automation exists yet. `pageElements/Shared/HomepageQuickActionsPage.ts`
  only smoke-tests that the "Generate a wallet QR" quick action opens *something* (dialog or navigation)
  in `BusinessTestCases/Homepage/functional/HomepageQuickActions.spec.ts` — it does not exercise QR-01
  through QR-17. Per `QA-DATA-TESTID-HANDOFF.md` §5, this screen has no `data-testid` coverage yet;
  request testids from FE before hardening this into a full suite.
- **Create Bill** — no automation exists yet (no prior page object for Bill Management/Add Bill in this
  repo, same testid gap as above).
- **Guest Flow** — `BusinessTestCases/PaymentLinks/` already has a **mock-only** suite
  (`PaymentLinkResolution.spec.ts`, `PaymentLinkPayerInfoRemoval.spec.ts`, `PaymentLinkBugs.spec.ts`,
  TC-PL-001–015) built for a different, earlier set of tickets (EMI-5463, EMI-5791–5794, EMI-5774/75/814).
  It is not registered in `docs/Automation_Test_Cases.md` yet. GF-01–GF-15 above target the *current*
  guest-flow tickets (EMI-5424/5446/5523/5551/5640/5653/5860) and are net-new — see the automation PR
  for `GuestWalletPayment.spec.ts`.
- **Wallet Balance Limits / Transaction Limits / Commission (sections G–R)** — all 152 cases have
  1:1 `test.skip()` stubs, exactly mirroring `BankTransferWalletLimits.spec.ts` /
  `BankTransferTransactionLimits.spec.ts` / `BankTransferCommission.spec.ts`'s pattern, pending the
  same class of Admin Portal automation helper (EMI-1653/EMI-195/EMI-87 for limits, EMI-2031 for
  commission) that EMI-180 is for Bank Transfer:
