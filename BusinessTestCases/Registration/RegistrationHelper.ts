/**
 * Drives goToFinancialStep for a caller that wants one dedicated identity of
 * its own (see getFreshResidentAsset), retrying across the reserved
 * DEDICATED_RESIDENT_ASSETS pool if a given asset turns out to have already
 * progressed past Business Info. That pool predates full used-flag tracking
 * (see markResidentAssetUsed) — a `used:false` entry can still turn out to
 * already be spent on the live UAT backend — so a single fixed pick isn't
 * reliable even when it's the only caller that ever draws it.
 *
 * Re-derives the available (used:false) set fresh on every attempt — rather
 * than filtering once up front and walking the result in order — so each
 * pick reflects every mark made so far this run (including ones just made
 * this loop) before it's attempted, and picks randomly among what's left
 * rather than sequentially, so a stale stretch in the pool doesn't get
 * walked in the same order attempt after attempt. Marks each discovered-stale
 * asset 'products' as it's found so later runs skip it too.
 *
 * Capped at 20 attempts rather than the full (60-asset) pool: live checks
 * have turned up a real stale rate well above what the local used:false
 * flags suggest (a pre-run check of this pool counted 12/60 already
 * 'products' — the same run then discovered 4 more among the 48 it thought
 * were fresh). Genuinely walking all 60 would be ~20-30 min of real UAT
 * round trips per test run. If 20 isn't enough, the fix is refreshing this
 * dataset against live backend state, not raising the cap further — see the
 * project's own conclusion on the shared pool for the same reasoning.
 *
 * Bails out of the dedicated pool early (DEDICATED_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD
 * consecutive already-progressed hits) rather than spending all maxAttempts
 * inside it: a run confirmed 18/60 dedicated assets already-progressed in a
 * single pass, and a bad random draw can chain enough of that stale 30% back
 * to back to burn the whole beforeEach timeout before ever reaching a fresh
 * one — see the RegistrationFinancialPage.spec.ts hook-timeout failure this
 * fixed. GENERAL_RESIDENT_ASSETS (nextResidentAsset()'s pool, ~900+ assets)
 * is checked flag-first the same way and is large enough that a fresh draw
 * is far more likely on the first try, so falling back there for the
 * remaining attempts trades a little of this pool's isolation guarantee for
 * a bounded worst-case runtime.
